# Bank-loan-report-analysis-and-visualization(Interactive Dashboard creation using Tableau)
## Project objective
This project analyzes a bank loan dataset to understand key financial metrics, borrower trends, default patterns, and loan health. The insights are presented through an interactive Tableau dashboard designed for clear decision-making and business reporting

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/salihcodes/Bank-loan-report-analysis-and-visualization/blob/main/Finance_1.xlsx">Dataset1</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/salihcodes/Bank-loan-report-analysis-and-visualization/blob/main/Finance_2.xlsx">Dataset2</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- KPI-1 : Year wise loan amount Stats
- KPI-2 : Grade and sub grade wise revol_bal
- KPI-3 : Total Payment for Verified Status Vs Total Payment for Non Verified Status
- KPI-4 : State wise and last_credit_pull_d wise loan status

## Process
- Developed SQL-based loan report with Tableau visualizations. 
- Created trend charts, regional maps, and KPI visuals.
- Performed ETL using SQL and loaded data into MySQL. 
- Calculated KPIs including good/bad loan percentage. 
- Added filters and drill-downs for deeper insights.

## Project insights
- Year-wise loan amount trends show how lending volume has changed over time, helping identify peak years and low-activity periods in the loan cycle.
- Grade and sub-grade analysis reveals strong differences in revolving balance (revol_bal), showing how borrower credit categories impact outstanding loan amounts.
- Verified vs. Non-Verified borrower payment comparison shows clear differences in repayment behavior, highlighting income verification as a major factor in loan reliability.
- State-wise and last_credit_pull_d-wise patterns uncover regional variations in loan activity and credit pull frequency, suggesting different borrower behavior across states.
- Combining Finance-1 and Finance-2 datasets enabled deeper cross-field insights, helping identify relationships between credit factors that wouldn’t be visible in a single dataset.

## Final conclusion
- 1. The analysis confirms that loan performance is influenced by borrower grade, verification status, and geographic location, requiring targeted lending strategies.
- Verified borrowers generally show better repayment discipline, proving the importance of income and identity verification in reducing loan default risk.
- State-wise differences in loan and credit activity indicate that regional financial behavior affects overall loan performance, supporting location-based risk assessment.
- Year-wise loan trends show steady growth in lending, indicating higher credit demand and increased participation from borrowers over time.
- Overall, the W Project provides a comprehensive and actionable overview of loan dynamics, supporting informed decision-making for financial institutions and improving risk management practices.
